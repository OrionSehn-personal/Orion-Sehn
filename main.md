## About Me
I'm a guy who likes to make bad jokes!

I am also interested in Computational Geometry, aperiodic tilings, pathing algorithms, and DevOps. I currently work for PCL construction as a Data Scientist. My current work focuses on doing graph visualization and path optimization, azure cloud parallelization (Azure Batch), and other fun stuff. 

This is a little place where I can make my projects available. 
> I'll likely remake this in a more professional format down the road.

## Projects - Things I've made

### Aperiodic Puzzle Generation and Edge Uniqueness Optimization

> This is a study on generating puzzle piece edges as a set of Bezier Curves, parameterizing their shape as an 18 dimensional vector with each component between 0 and 1. The challenge was to maximize the uniqueness of each of these edges by choosing these components to be as different as possible from the rest of the puzzle piece edges. The algorithm is applied to generate puzzles of different types of tiling, square, triangular, and Penrose, although in theory, it could be applied to any set of lines.
